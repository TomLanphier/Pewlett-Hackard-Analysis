# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett Hackard (PH) is preparing for the upcoming retirement of the Baby Boomer generation, an event which is being called the "silver tsunami." PH is preparing for this because they offer a retirement package for their employees who meet a certain criterion and because they need to fill the positions which will be vacated by the "silver tsunami." The two main questions are who will be retiring, and how many positions will need to be filled? The data needed to answer this was originally stored in 6 CSV files as HP were primarily using Excel and VBA to work with their data. To "Future Proof" their company, they've decided to update their methods by using SQL. A mentorship program has also been suggested to ensure the employees who are retiring will pass on their knowledge to the employees who will fill the vacated positions. 

The two main questions were answered in the analysis using SQL. Two further questions have been assigned: how many employees of each title are retiring, and which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program?

## Results
- Of the 90,398 employees who will be retiring as part of the "silver tsunami," over two thirds (62,172) of them will are in elevated roles such as manager (2), senior staff (28,254), senior engineer (29,414) or technique leader (4,502). The remaining third are in common positions (staff, engineer, or assistant engineer).
- Of the nine departments, only two will have their managers retire as part of the "silver tsunami."
- There are 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
- Most of the eligible employees are in elevated roles such as senior staff (569), senior engineer (529), and technique leader (77).

## Summary
High level summaries:
- 90,398 roles will need to be filled as a result of the "silver tsunami."
- On average, each mentorship qualified employee will need to take on over 58 mentees to have all the vacancies caused by the "silver tsunami" filled by an employee who has been mentored.

Two additional tables that would be helpful would be:
- The average number of roles the "silver tsunami" employees have held by position.
- The total salaries of the "silver tsunami" employees by department.
